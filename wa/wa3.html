        <p>Polyphia is a primarily instrumental <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock" title = "Progressive Rock">progressive rock</a> band based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plano,_Texas" title="Plano">Plano, Texas</a>, formed in 2010. 
            The group consists of guitarists Tim Henson and Scott LePage, bassist Clay Gober, and drummer Clay Aeschliman.</p>

        <p>Polyphia's sound is noted for incorporating virtuosic guitar parts with other styles of music. Initially rooted in a metal-focused tone in their early releases, they developed their music into a more 
        progressive rock sound, combining electronic music and hip hop in their later productions. Polyphia has released four studio albums, two EPs, and numerous singles. Their fourth album, <em>Remember That You Will Die</em>, released in October 2022, was the first to 
        chart, debuting at number 33 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200">Billboard 200</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="History">History</h2>

            <p>Polyphia first achieved mainstream success when the guitar play-through of "Impassion", from their EP <em>Inspire</em>, went viral on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">Youtube</a>. Since then, 
                the band's popularity has grown and they have shared the stage with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_metalcore" title="Progressive Metalcore">progressive metalcore</a> artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periphery_(band)">Periphery</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_Buried_and_Me">Between the Buried and Me</a>, 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Burns_Red">August Burns Red</a>.</p>

            <p>The band states that their influences come from artists of all genres. The group started out with a heavier shred-oriented 
                sound but has since matured into a more melodic-focused band. When describing the album <em>Muse</em>, guitarist Tim Henson says that 
                the primary inspiration came from pop and rap music.</p>

            <p>In a 2013 interview, when asked about the name of the band the following answer was given:</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;">It comes from the word "Polyphony", meaning "music whose texture is defined by the interweaving of several melodic lines". Playing off this definition, as a band, we capitalize on musicianship and that, 
                musically, each member of the band is a cornerstone of our sound. We stray from the idea of a one-dimensional, vocal-centered, or guitar-centered, or drum-centered group, and let each member of the band play an integral part in 
                the overall product. As a people, all of us have a unique and personal identity that makes us dynamic and purposeful, and our band means to convey this quality within all of us through our music; never diminishing the potential 
                of others and thriving in unity.</p>

            <p>In September 2022, Polyphia released the single "Ego Death", the fourth from their latest album, <em>Remember That You Will Die</em>. 
                The release was accompanied by a video, both of which feature guitar virtuoso <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Vai">Steve Vai</a>. <em>Remember That You Will Die</em> was released on October 28, 2022, 
                and includes guest appearances by Sophia Black, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasstracks">Brasstracks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snot_(rapper)">Snot</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_Moreno">Chino Moreno</a> and the aforementioned Vai. 
                The band have announced a 15-date European tour to support it.</p>

            <p>The band was originally known for classical guitar covers on YouTube. Their first EP, <em>Inspire</em>, and first LP, <em>Muse</em>, 
                both show the band's appreciation for pop music. However, both works employ more progressive 
                metal influences than their later releases. This associated them with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent">djent</a> movement, although they were 
                characteristically less heavy and more melody-based than their peers. Their second studio album, <em>Renaissance</em>, 
                saw the band diverge further away from metal, into a more progressive rock and math rock-influenced sound. They also began to mix elements of EDM, 
                funk, and hip hop, with the single "LIT", a remix of the song "Light", the second track on <em>Renaissance</em>. This sound was further developed with the 
                release of their second EP, <em>The Most Hated</em>, and third LP, <em>New Levels New Devils</em>, which featured production from hip hop and EDM producers Judge and Y2K.
                The band's fourth studio album, <em>Remember That You Will Die</em>, has continued in this vein, further exploring "trap percussion and hip hop stylings", as well as 
                incorporating a variety of genres, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_music">bubblegum pop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossa_nova">bossa nova</a> .</p>
